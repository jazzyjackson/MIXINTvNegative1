 This program provides instructions to a node serer on how to respond to network requests
 The request method, url, and headers may be inspected to determine what data to send back
 if a GET request was made to a directory, find a figtree in that directory (or its parents) for instructions on how to build a new workspace
 if a GET request is made to a static file, stream that file from disk to client (pipe fs.createReadStream to response)
 if a POST request is made, (attempt to) execute the query and pipe the child process to the response. Permissions errors are returned to client.
 if a DELETE request is made, (attempt to) delete the file specified. Permissions errors are returned to client.
 if a PUT request is made, (attempt to) write request body to disk. Permissions error yada yada.
 doesnt care what version of node is running
 its just detecting request headers and 
 oh maybe pipe transforms don't work in 0.6.0 or something. like the transform interface is different
 but shouldn't matter as long as it aint called\
 and bones.html 
 operator might check an environment variable
 and return bones.html for all get requests if figtree can't run
 oh try to run figtree but if it throws an error then return 
 actually maybe figtree can do that process.versions.node
 give up and stream bones.html if 'await' isn't a thing
