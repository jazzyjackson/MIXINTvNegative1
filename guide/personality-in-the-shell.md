Step back, chatbot personalities that control the computer?

I'm approaching AI from a pre-neural net perspective - that intelligence is not emergent (at least not from silicon) ... something that happens by uploading all the data to a thinking machine, but that machines could be made to appear intelligent by careful design of decision making systems. A sophisticated algorithm helps you make a decision, but it doesn't do the thinking for you, it is just carrying out the thinking of whoever designed it.

(For the record, I don't suppose that our intelligence was designed by a higher intelligence, I only suppose that the universe eventually arranges itself into all possible states, so there will be pockets of self propogating entropy-reducers every once in a while, or maybe just once.)

 (neural net designers don't usually insist that their programs possess intelligence, but thinking machines have been in the public mind a long time now, neural nets are only the latest mechanical curiosity that seem to have minds of their own)
