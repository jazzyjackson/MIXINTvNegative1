#### Chatrooms of Your Own Design
_OR, I've never seen a polite conversation on facebook trending_

The internet offers a lot of ways for people to communicate. The copper that the early internet ran on top of was still routing telegrams, so of course mail became email without much fuss. But the fact that a reply could be expected immediately changed what conversations people have.

Chatrooms where you could join and leave at will and have as many people as you wanted lead to conversations among people who would never cross paths in real life, out of geographic or social distance. There are a lot of these spaces 

Identity plays a big role in conversations. You could come up with alter egos, be required by EULA to represent your legal identity, or be totally anonymous. If you're trying to be yourself, you're likely to stay ideologically consistent. If someone makes a personal attack. People will threaten you if they know it will scare you, and the only reason threats online are scary is because our real-life identities are so readily accessible on most social networks. Beyond the physical threat, can personal attacks exist in a space without ego? On 4chan image boards, there is no name attached to posts. You're left without a way to refer to other individuals. So you can shout slurs if you want, but who are you shouting at?

My point is that the choices of what information a chatroom provides changes what chats happen in them. Not just whether your real name is attached to each message, but if the conversation is public or private, or if the messages will still exist in 24 hours, or if you can attach images to your message, or if you can delete messages.

Consider the factors that may affect what you post on a website:
- whether your real identity is attached to the message
- who can see the conversation you're having
- how much effort does it take to leave a message (do you have to sign up for an account? or are you always signed in anyway?)
- will the messages still exist in 24 hours? who can read the archive?
- whether a character limit is enforced
- is the composition of your message interrupted by new messages before you're done typing?
- can someone enter the room at any time and see the old messages?
- can you be kicked out of the room? By whom?
- can you edit your message after its posted?
- do other participants know you edited it? Can they see the previous edits?
- can other people edit your message?
- are you allowed to edit the stylesheet of a message?
- Will the message interrupt a recipient with a notification? Or will they come back to the conversation when they want to. 

These are choices that the designer of every chatroom makes, and I think it is important to use chatrooms that encourage the conversation you wish to have.


I hope to see much experimentation in the design of chatrooms.

I can imagine a reddit-wiki mashup where a debate is happening, and you have 5 minutes to respond, and the two sides could, pubically or privately, flesh out and edit their response, work on different responses, vote which response they want to use, and wherever they're at, it gets posted, and they have to wait for the next round

all kinds of idea games
