### The Environment That Modifies Itself
Javascript is a fairly unique language, taking cues from an ancestor, a computer language called LISP, which was designed to be able to change what functions do after the program has started. So LISP became a language to experiment with language, to create learning machines and self-modifying programs. 

Emacs was bourne out of this tradition, as a program that existed nominally as an editor, allowing for code to be written to extend and customize Emacs itself. Soon people were writing mail clients and filesystem browsers so they could use the whole computer without ever leaving emacs. 

Multi-Interpreter also aims to continue the tradition, providing a web application that can change how it works while it's running. New capabilities can be added on the fly.
