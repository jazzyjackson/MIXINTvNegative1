political:
Express the depth of datamining conversational and emotive data, encourage keeping your face to yourself. State the goal of teaching guasi-emotive machines to make appropriate expressions following text and inflection scripts of interactive conversation. Reflect on whose expressions will be used. Do you want to train facebook's AI? google assistants'? or an open bizarre where groups can trade packages of expression-contexts.

Remove centralized influence by distributing the advantages of automation outside the cloud. Spinning up servers is one click now, why give all your data to amazon/facebook/google ?
