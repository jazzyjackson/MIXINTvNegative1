a codemirror component should be extended with methods for selecting text or provided chatbot with the text selected, pairs with its source on file

that really cool thing about my searches being mediated by the interpreter, 

well the commands dont have to be logged, but I want iframes to be. maybe oh starting with an exclamation can be handled by chatscript, return the function
