a figurl for a particular reminder list or calendar - the file exists in your home folder, but you can refer and edit it in a variety of interfaces. Maybe a mobile app
(Oh hey figurl to cordova app please lol)

It would be really easy to extend it to a database , relational or not, but why bother?
human readable is bot readable, easiest to write programs for

You can open up a document. make some change. Get a link to the workspace, grab the figurl, and someone else can join you with the file open and everything

depending on their userid, maybe they can put changes, maybe not. The interface will hit up options request to ask for rwx permission and not let you change it, but if you get around that the server will still stop you .  

When reddit does a live thread, its just a bunch of people following a thread appended to by a few

I think that's a great model
anyone should be able to start one
partyline

but nobodies can follow along
they could even start their own commentating on the first one

feeds where your community can comment on the feeds

and feeds can be combined and commented on

some real dataflow graphs there holy cow

if git pull works the way I want it to...

threads and spools

The first step is to build a platform that can do all the work of your typical webserver, but has the power to change its own configuration and read its own error messages.

But before trying to explain what a self-aware web server looks like, I want to provide a minimal configuration that is immediately useful.

Poly-Int aims to make it easy to do all the things computers are good at, including:
- Sharing files on a local network, or uploading files to a server to share online
- Message passing between friends and co-workers
- Modify the user interface to access and edit messages, files, and programs
- Scheduling assistance to set alarms and run programs
- Explain what available programs do and offer you many options on how to run them
- Archiving files, keeping records and tracking changes to all of them

On top of this central functionality, an application can be cloned and modified. 
- Serve a simple static website
- allow user actions to fire off specific functions - store or fetch data, send a text message
- give a custom interface to the chatbot, even design a video game around the chat script.
