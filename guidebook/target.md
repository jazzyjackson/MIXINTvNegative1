I suppose a default configuration could be that a convoshell has a target directory 

so when you cd in the convoshell, the target directory follows you. That would be interesting.

the notion of a working directory carried over into browsing up and down the file tree, I don't know, I think I like it. 

But what happens if you have multiple directory blocks, like you tell a file you opened to become... well I guess only the first on is that target, so it has to be (or can start by being) bidirectional



oh man textblocks should have a word wrap option
