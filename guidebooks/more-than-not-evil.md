A thought while reading [The Parable of Google Flu:
Traps in Big Data Analysis](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0314policyforumff.pdf):
```
Google is a business, but it also holds in
trust data on the desires, thoughts, and the
connections of humanity. Making money
“without doing evil” (paraphrasing Google’s
motto) is not enough when it is feasible to do
so much good.
```

What a mess we've gotten into, all our most valuable data is a trade secret. 
If poly-int were used as a web portal, tracking very high-resolution data about who you talk to, what you talk about, and what you search for in between, then little packages of high-resolution activity could be traded and aggregated by whoever thought it was valuable. As an operator you have the choice of what activity to track, and how much information to keep (strip it of IP addresses yourself). - show how to subscribe to access logs.

Not a personal assistant, but an operator.
