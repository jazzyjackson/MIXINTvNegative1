Just for me to complain about what annoys me about computers, and how I'm trying to address my own issues by writing better software.

The way to sync files with a web server. Traditionally you might set up an FTP client, which has its own learning curve and its own security set up - asking people who are new at things to set up their own security (sign their own key, don't share the key, use a good password) is going to wind up with lots of insecure servers. Anyway. It's confusing, its slow, and unless you get familiar with how to move your keys and configs around, it keeps you stuck to the machine that you set it up with. 

Editing files forces you try out things on your local machine and then push the changes to a remote server before the changes take effect. 

The frameworks that generate files so you can't figure out what file effects what until you understand the whole system
The frameworks that produce error messages that don't touch your own code, you have no idea how you broke it

People aren't really sure what the certificate means
that its a means of authentication of the source
that you can trust content is coming from a computer whose key you recognize
and that no one but your machine and the machine reading the reponse can see the content

So people dont trust machines

So I want code that you could conceivably understand, or at least
