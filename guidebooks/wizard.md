in order to upgrade node
and upgrade chromium
even if you're on an old raspberry pi or something like that

start the server

255 is 8bit
24bit IP address

It would be cool to make a little shield
touch sensitive LED brightness
but write to a little multiplexer the ip address in hex

and that's your first thing
count the LEDs

yo yo yo yo yo yo
SAY
on raspberry pi
is it there?
hahahhaha duh

yeah definitely needs to broadcast its own little numbers station
decide what else you want to play over audio out
but by default
just say the IP address on repeat

so anyway it installs itself and boots and with your help installs updates
like sure it could run a bash script too

so there would be a tradition of editing the tech support chatbot
that tells you what you need to do, or puts you in touch with someone? I don't know

so you get the IP address and open it in any browser in the network
could be your phone, that's cool.
talk to the bot get it all set up
